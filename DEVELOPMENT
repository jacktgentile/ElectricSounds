## April 18-20
* Generated ElectricSounds openframeworks project in Visual Studio
* Takes volume input and writes current volume to the window
* Draws a rectangle with dynamic width based on current volume
* In a seperate application, I made a dynamic circle which changed radius using arrow keys
	* Will use this method to have radius be volume controlled
	* Volume needs to be smoothed first, as cur_vol_ changes too fast
* Unable to read pitch using Gist library so far
	* Will research different libraries, or implement [Yin method](http://audition.ens.fr/adc/pdf/2002_JASA_YIN.pdf) myself in a seperate class
## April 22
* Smoothed volume is calculated in audioIn
* Integrated moving circles to the project using a circle_shape struct
	* Has its own update and draw functions
	* Similar structures can be used for different shapes
* Added states RUNNING and PAUSED to the program
	* Press 'P' to Pause, 'U' to Unpause
* "new file: .vs/ElectricSounds/v14/.suo" accidental commit message
	* Getting the hang of committing through command line, though
